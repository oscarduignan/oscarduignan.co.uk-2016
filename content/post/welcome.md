I live in London with my wife Kim and daughter Lumen. At the moment I support us financially by building websites for a living Tuesday through Friday. I like to dance. I try to write. I want to draw.

# What am I working on now?

I'm reading a lot of books on Stoicism and psychotherapy (mostly CBT). I'm starting to dip into Iain Bank's Culture books.

There's a kids book in me I want to write for my daughter with my wife's help.

I want to scratch an itch by building a better-for-me time tracking service that you use primarily through a browser extension. I was building the back end with the Phoenix Framework in Elixir and the front end with React and RxJS but I've not had time to work on this in a while.

I'm starting work again with a couple of good friends on their 2-degrees-of-separation hospitality-exchange network-of-trust app. We're using Meteor, React, and Neo4j to try and make this fit in the time between all our other responsibilities.

I've got a 2016 daily wall calendar that I'm going to try and leverage into maintaining a consistent exercise habit throughout the coming year. Hopefully I'll also soon start some self defense classes again and every day I grow more determined to learn how to lift and to regularly run.

# How is this site built?

I write the content for this site in Markdown, which I give to a static site generator called Hugo that converts it into HTML. Then I use a tool called s3-website to compress and push the built site to Amazon S3 where it is hosted. The main fonts used on the site are X and Y and they come from Google Fonts service. I manage the CSS, JS, other assets used to create the sites design and functionality using Webpack. You can view the source code for this website on Github.
